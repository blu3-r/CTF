Okay, a simple viginere cipher, I solve it manual !!!
We know the format of flag. d4rk{}c0de
so 
>g4iu -> d4rk

>e0gi -> c0de

We have to take a closer look at diagonal of the Viginere Cipher Table.

Then, I guess some common English Words combined with characters on the diagonal of table. 
Finally, I got the flag
>d4rk{how_uncreative_is_that!}c0de
